1. Download Python3
2. Install Python Libraries(numpy,random, sklearn)
3. Run the python program through desired IDE or terminal and observe results

It is possible to run the program multiple times to observe different burst time allocations and observe how that will
change the algorithm's prediction of which job scheduler will finish first.
